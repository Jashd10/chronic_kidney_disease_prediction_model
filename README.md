# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Model

A machine learning-based application for predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using patient health data. This model leverages advanced algorithms and a Streamlit-based interactive interface to assist in early detection through key health parameters like blood pressure, sugar levels, and serum creatinine.

## Features
- **Accurate Predictions:** ML model trained on CKD datasets for reliable results.
- **Interactive Interface:** Built with Streamlit for seamless user interaction.
- **Data Visualization:** Graphical representations to interpret patient health metrics.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chronic_kidney_prediction_model.git
   cd chronic_kidney_prediction_model
